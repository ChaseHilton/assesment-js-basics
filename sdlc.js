// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirments = "is the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product."

const design = "Design Code means a code setting out the broad means parameters with reference to which the Developer will secure uniform standards of design quality, character of design, building materials, density of development and site layout within the Forestmill Site."

const implementation = "is a realization of a technical specification or algorithm as a program, software component, or other computer system through computer programming and deployment."

const testingAndIntegration = "is a realization of a technical specification or algorithm as a program, software component, or other computer system through computer programming and deployment."

const Maintain = "to evolve new ways doing things you used to do which would overall improve the efficiency of your code base"
